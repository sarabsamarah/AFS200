Description of how it's possible to run Python code in Scrimba's frontend interface, using the Brython add-in which converts python code to javascript. Shows where the script is called in the index.html file, and how to activate the bigger Brython standard library for running more advanced python code.
Brython is designed to replace Javascript as the scripting language for the Web. As such, it is a Python 3 implementation (you can take it for a test drive through a web console), adapted to the HTML5 environment, that is to say with an interface to the DOM objects and events.User input in Python
To get user input in Python (3), the command you use is input(). Store the result in a variable, and use it to your heartâ€™s content. Remember that the result you get from the user will be a string, even if they enter a number.
